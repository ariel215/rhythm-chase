# rhythm-chase


Ok, now that we've done some basics, and felt it getting harder and harder to add things,
let's do some design^2

Things that I want to make: 
- grimy beats
- vaguely ominous poetry
- some kind of rhythm component

Ideas: 

- wander through rooms in time to music
- small rhythm challenges? 
- narrative interludes

Systems: 
- the big one: the music system
  - global clock keeps steady beat
  - matched to songs
  - subdivisions i.e. patterns
  - hookable triggers and durations
  - with wiggle room

tiles / map

- movement
  - on the global beat

- text boxes etc
